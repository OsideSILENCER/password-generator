# password-generator
My password generator project

This project was my attempt to generate a password utilizing javascript which appears to have been successful.

My motivation ws that I want to be a highly sought after full stack software developer.
I built this project to test my skills in Javascript and determine how much i need to improve.
The problem that bulding this project solved was a overconfidence complex that I had in relation to javascript.
I learned that I a lot to learn in relation to software development but if I perservere then I will succeed.

In order to install this prject I first had to determine psuedo code. Then I had to determine the the functions that I would use to create the password generator. Then I had to test the functions in the browser and check the console elements for any faulty code. Once I completed this trial and error process till the end of the code, my password generator was ready to deploy.

In order to utilize this project simply type in for desired passcode of no more than 12 characters with non-discrimination of letter, number or symbol value and then click the big red generate password button. Nothing follows.
